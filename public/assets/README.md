# 3D Assets Required

To complete the 3D card functionality, you need to add the following files to this directory:

1. **newgaterecard.glb** - The 3D model file for the business card
   - This should be a GLTF/GLB file containing the card geometry with nodes named: 'card', 'clip', 'clamp'
   - You can create this in Blender or any 3D modeling software
   
2. **gatereband.png** - The texture for the rope/band effect
   - This should be a seamless texture image
   - Recommended size: 512x512px or 1024x1024px

## Creating the 3D Model

If you need to create the 3D model yourself:

1. Open Blender or your preferred 3D modeling software
2. Create a card shape (rectangular plane) - approximately 3.5 x 2 units
3. Add small details like a clip and clamp for visual interest
4. Export as GLB format
5. Make sure to name the meshes: 'card', 'clip', 'clamp'

## Alternative Solution

If you don't have the 3D assets, you can modify the Card3D component to use simple Three.js geometries instead of loading external models.
